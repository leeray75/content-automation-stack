# Issue #2 Completion Report: MCP Ingestion Service Pino-Pretty Fix

## Summary
Successfully resolved the MCP ingestion service crash caused by missing `pino-pretty` dependency. The service was failing to start due to a logger configuration error where `pino-pretty` was referenced but not installed as a dependency.

## Implementation Details

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue**: MCP ingestion service was crashing with error: `Error: unable to determine transport target for "pino-pretty"`
- **Cause**: The logger configuration in `src/utils/logger.js` was attempting to use `pino-pretty` for development logging, but the package was not included in the production dependencies
- **Impact**: Service was stuck in a restart loop, preventing the entire stack from functioning properly

### Files Modified
- `content-automation-platform/content-automation-stack/services/content-automation-mcp-ingestion/package.json` - Added `pino-pretty` dependency
- `content-automation-platform/content-automation-stack/services/content-automation-mcp-ingestion/package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree

### Key Changes Implemented
1. **Added Missing Dependency**: Added `"pino-pretty": "^11.2.2"` to the dependencies section of package.json
2. **Updated Lock File**: Ran `npm install` to update package-lock.json with the new dependency
3. **Rebuilt Docker Image**: Performed a clean rebuild of the ingestion service Docker image to include the new dependency
4. **Verified Fix**: Confirmed all services are now running and healthy

### Technical Decisions
- **Dependency Placement**: Added `pino-pretty` to production dependencies rather than devDependencies because the logger configuration conditionally uses it based on NODE_ENV
- **Version Selection**: Used version `^11.2.2` to match current pino ecosystem compatibility
- **Build Strategy**: Used `--no-cache` flag during Docker rebuild to ensure fresh installation of dependencies

## Testing Results
- **Service Status**: All containers now show "Up (healthy)" status
- **Health Endpoints**: 
  - API: `http://localhost:3000/health` ✅ Returns healthy status
  - MCP Ingestion: `http://localhost:3002/health` ✅ Returns healthy status  
  - UI: `http://localhost:3001` ✅ Loads successfully
- **Container Logs**: No more crash loops or pino-pretty errors
- **Stack Integration**: All services can communicate properly

## Build Context Discovery
During troubleshooting, discovered that the Docker Compose build context points to `./services/content-automation-mcp-ingestion/` rather than the main project directory. This required updating the package.json in the services subdirectory rather than the main project directory.

## Documentation Updates
- [x] Created completion report
- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md with fix details
- [x] Documented build context discovery for future reference

## Next Steps
- Monitor service stability over time
- Consider centralizing dependency management if multiple services use similar logging configurations
- Review other services for similar potential dependency issues

- GitHub Issue: [#2](https://github.com/leeray75/content-automation-stack/issues/2)
- Services Directory: `content-automation-platform/content-automation-stack/services/`
- Health Endpoints: API (3000), MCP (3002), UI (3001)

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check service status
cd content-automation-platform/content-automation-stack
docker compose ps

# Test health endpoints
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/health
curl -sS http://localhost:3002/health
curl -sS http://localhost:3001

# View logs if needed
docker compose logs content-automation-mcp-ingestion
