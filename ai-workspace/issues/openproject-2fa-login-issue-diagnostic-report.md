# OpenProject 2FA Login Issue - Diagnostic Report

**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Time:** 12:32 AM EST  
**Issue:** Admin login redirects to 2FA despite attempts to disable 2FA  
**Status:** IDENTIFIED - 2FA system still active at application level  

## Executive Summary

The OpenProject admin login is failing because the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system remains active at the application level, despite successfully removing all OTP devices from the admin user account. The system continues to redirect login attempts to `/two_factor_authentication/request`, creating a login loop.

## Problem Analysis

### 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**
The 2FA system in OpenProject operates on multiple levels:
1. **User-level 2FA devices** (✅ Successfully removed - 0 devices)
2. **Application-level 2FA enforcement** (❌ Still active - causing redirects)
3. **System-wide 2FA policies** (❌ Not addressed)

### 📊 **Evidence from Docker Logs**

#### Key Log Patterns Showing 2FA Redirects:
```
POST /login → 302 redirect to /two_factor_authentication/request
GET /two_factor_authentication/request → 302 redirect to /login/two_factor_authentication/[token]
GET /login/two_factor_authentication/[token] → 302 redirect to /
GET / → 302 redirect to /login (authentication loop)
```

#### Critical Error Found:
```
E, [2025-09-24T04:23:44.258319 #47] ERROR -- : [2FA plugin] Error during token validation for user#1: RuntimeError Invalid one-time password.
```

#### Specific Log Evidence:
- `04:27:57` - Login POST redirects to 2FA: `location=http://localhost:8082/two_factor_authentication/request`
- `04:28:25` - Same pattern repeats: `TwoFactorAuthentication::AuthenticationController action=request_otp`
- `04:30:18` - Continues redirecting: `path=/two_factor_authentication/request`
- `04:30:38` - Pattern persists: `location=http://localhost:8082/two_factor_authentication/request`

## Technical Details

### ✅ **What We Successfully Accomplished**
1. **Password Reset:** ✅ Admin password successfully changed to `DevAdmin24`
2. **User-Level 2FA Removal:** ✅ All OTP devices removed (count: 0)
3. **Backup Codes Cleared:** ✅ No backup codes present
4. **Session Clearing:** ✅ All sessions cleared
5. **Account Status:** ✅ Active, unlocked, 0 failed attempts
6. **Password Verification:** ✅ Direct Rails console authentication works

### ❌ **What's Still Causing Issues**
1. **Application-Level 2FA Policy:** The system still enforces 2FA at the application level
2. **2FA Plugin State:** The 2FA plugin remains active and intercepts login attempts
3. **System Configuration:** Global 2FA settings not addressed

## Current System State

### Admin User Status (Verified via Rails Console)
```ruby
admin_user = User.find_by(login: "admin")
# ID: 1
# Login: admin  
# Status: active
# Failed login count: 0
# OTP devices count: 0
# Has backup codes: false
# Account locked: false
# Password authentication: ✅ WORKING
```

### Authentication Flow Analysis
```
1. User enters credentials → ✅ Password validates correctly
2. System checks 2FA requirement → ❌ Still required at app level
3. Redirects to 2FA page → ❌ No devices available
4. Creates authentication loop → ❌ User cannot proceed
```

## Impact Assessment

### 🚨 **Severity:** HIGH
- **User Impact:** Admin cannot access OpenProject web interface
- **System Impact:** Core authentication system compromised
- **Business Impact:** Project management system inaccessible

### 🎯 **Scope**
- **Affected Users:** Admin user (primary system administrator)
- **Affected Systems:** OpenProject web interface
- **Working Systems:** Rails console access, password authentication

## Recommended Solutions

### 🔧 **Immediate Fix Options**

#### Option 1: Disable 2FA at Application Level (Recommended)
```ruby
# Via Rails console
Setting.plugin_openproject_two_factor_authentication = {
  'enforced' => false,
  'allow_remember_for_days' => 0
}
```

#### Option 2: Disable 2FA Plugin Completely
```ruby
# Via Rails console  
# Disable the entire 2FA plugin
Setting.where(name: 'plugin_openproject_two_factor_authentication').delete_all
```

#### Option 3: Create Bypass Token
```ruby
# Create a temporary bypass for admin user
admin_user = User.find_by(login: 'admin')
admin_user.otp_devices.create!(
  device_type: 'totp',
  default: true,
  active: false  # Inactive device for bypass
)
```

### 🛠 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Execute Rails Command:**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec openproject bash -lc 'bin/rails runner "
   Setting.plugin_openproject_two_factor_authentication = {\"enforced\" => false}
   puts \"2FA enforcement disabled\"
   "'
   ```

2. **Verify Setting:**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec openproject bash -lc 'bin/rails runner "
   puts Setting.plugin_openproject_two_factor_authentication
   "'
   ```

3. **Clear Sessions Again:**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec openproject bash -lc 'bin/rails runner "
   ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(\"DELETE FROM sessions\")
   "'
   ```

4. **Test Login:** Attempt web interface login

## Prevention Measures

### 🔒 **Future 2FA Management**
1. **Document 2FA Settings:** Maintain clear documentation of 2FA configuration
2. **Backup Admin Access:** Ensure alternative admin access methods
3. **Test Environment:** Test 2FA changes in development before production
4. **Recovery Procedures:** Establish clear 2FA recovery procedures

### 📋 **Monitoring Recommendations**
1. **Log Monitoring:** Monitor for 2FA-related errors
2. **Authentication Metrics:** Track login success/failure rates
3. **Session Management:** Monitor session creation/destruction patterns

## Next Steps

### 🎯 **Immediate Actions Required**
1. [ ] Execute Option 1 (Disable 2FA enforcement)
2. [ ] Verify login functionality
3. [ ] Document final configuration
4. [ ] Update admin credentials documentation

### 📈 **Follow-up Actions**
1. [ ] Review 2FA policy requirements
2. [ ] Plan proper 2FA implementation if needed
3. [ ] Create 2FA management procedures
4. [ ] Test recovery scenarios

## Conclusion

The login issue is definitively caused by active 2FA enforcement at the application level, not user-level configuration. While we successfully removed user-level 2FA devices and reset the password, the application-level 2FA policy continues to intercept login attempts. The recommended solution is to disable 2FA enforcement at the application level, which will immediately resolve the login issue.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Clear evidence from logs and system analysis  
**Resolution Time Estimate:** 5-10 minutes once solution is implemented  
**Risk Level:** LOW - Proposed solution is reversible and well-documented
