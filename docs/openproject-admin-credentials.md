- **Note:** The 6-digit one-time passwords are generated from the secret key above

### Environment Configuration
- Password stored in `.env` file as `OPENPROJECT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=DevAdmin24`
- Configuration persists across container restarts

## Reset History

**Last Reset:** September 24, 2025 at 12:18 AM EST  
**Reset Method:** Direct database modification via Rails console  
**Previous Issues Resolved:**
- 2FA enforcement blocking login
- Failed login attempt counter
- Forced password change requirement

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Information:**
- This is a development/local environment
- Credentials are stored in plain text for development purposes
- For production use, implement proper secret management
- Consider enabling proper 2FA for production environments

## Troubleshooting

### If Login Fails
1. Verify OpenProject container is running: `docker compose ps`
2. Check container logs: `docker compose logs openproject`
3. Ensure no typos in username/password
4. Clear browser cache and cookies for localhost:8082

### If 2FA Issues Occur
- **Expected Behavior:** Login should bypass 2FA completely
- **If prompted for 6-digit code:** This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
  
  **Option 1: Use TOTP App (Recommended)**
  1. Install Google Authenticator, Authy, or similar TOTP app
  2. Add account manually using secret: `JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`
  3. Enter the 6-digit code generated by the app
  
  **Option 2: Generate Code via Command Line**
  ```bash
  # Install oathtool if not available
  brew install oath-toolkit  # macOS
  # or
  sudo apt-get install oathtool  # Ubuntu/Debian
  
  # Generate current 6-digit code
  oathtool --totp -b JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
  ```
  
  **Option 3: Remove 2FA Device**
  ```bash
  cd content-automation-platform/content-automation-stack
  docker compose exec openproject bash -lc 'bin/rails runner "
    u = User.find_by(login: \"admin\")
    u.otp_required_for_login = false
    u.save!(validate: false)
    puts \"2FA disabled for admin user\"
  "'
  ```

### Container Management
```bash
# Start the stack
docker compose up -d

# Stop the stack  
docker compose down

# View logs
docker compose logs openproject

# Access Rails console
docker compose exec openproject bash -lc 'bin/rails console'
```
